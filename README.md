### Workflow
1. Check that you have all the components of the audiobook
1. Label all the logical sections.<br />Refer to the table of contents.
1. Make sure you have the preliminary header and concluding materials (metadata).
1. Finesse the audio quality *last*.

### Transmission

* ``.tar.xz``-ed WAVs
* **Tarball Audacity Projects**
* **Do not transmit MP3 to editors**
* Clean 8.3 Filenames<br />`([A-Z0-9]{1,8})(\.{0,1}[A-Z0-9]{1,3})`

	<blockquote><center><b>x&#x131;o&rsquo;s <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">mantra</span></b><br /><center>Never underestimate the ubiquity of and reliance upon irreplaceable and unupgradeable well past end-of-life equipment fulfilling mission-ciritical production roles.</center></blockquote>

# Workflow
1. Committing to the project
1. Assembly:
	* Talent
	* Time
	* Money
2. Divide the book into logical chunks and divide the work accordingly.
	* Let the table of contents guide you
1. Each section is recorded and sent to QC.
1. QC sends back list of fixes.
1. When there are no fixes left, the recording(s) go to postproduction and production proceeds onto the next logical chunk.
1. Postproduction submits the master* copy for distribution.

&#x2a; "prime", "pristine", "finalized"

## Studio Recordings

* Narrator and director work as a team.
* Engineer and director provide immediate quality assurance
* Director and quality control cooperate directly with each other.
* Errors are caught in a timely manner.

## Remote recordings

1. There's no director to sustain quality assurance.
1. There's no engineer to maintain technological assets.
1. There's no quality control because "deadline".
1. Lack of communication leads to lack of cooperation.
1. Life happens.
1. Participants drop out of the project.

	<q>Don't allow the task ahead of you to be greater than the enthusiasm behind you.</q><br />&mdash; Leonard Buchanan, "Digital Dilithium Dahlias: How to program a computer simulation"; Antic Magazine, March 1986 ([vol. 4, no. 11](https://www.atarimagazines.com/v4n11/DilithiumDahlias.html)) [p. 40](https://archive.org/details/1986-03-anticmagazine/page/n39/mode/1up)

&#x2a; Books narrated from home studios tend to pass rudimentary quality control requirements (noise abatement, room tone continuity, signal-to-noise ration) but tend to require greater postproduction to remove mouth noises (lip smacking, whistling noses, rumbling stomachs).
