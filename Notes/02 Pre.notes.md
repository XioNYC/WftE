# Pre-Production

## Is the Work Worth Recording?
* Is this book any good?
* Who is the target audience?
* What is the demand for this book?
* Does this book already exist as an audiobook or talking book?
* Does this book translate well into audio?
* Do you have the time?
* Do you have the talent?
* Do you have the funding?
* Do you have the necessary copyright clearances?

### Works Not Worth Recording
* Bibles<br />Seriously... don't.  The market is oversaturated.
* Children's Books<br />Children's books are some of the toughest books to read and are the most demanding of the talent.  Leave it to the professionals.
* Fanfic<br />Nobody is interested in *50 Shades of Greybeard with the NFT Tatoo*
* "Foreign" Language<br />Native speakers are *not necessarily* native readers.  Proficiency is not fluency.
* "Hot" Books<br />Anything that runs the risk of becoming obsolete.

### Works That *Might* be Worth Recording
* Magazines
* Periodicals
* Serialized Works
