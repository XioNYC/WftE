# Workflow
1. Committing to the project
1. Assembly:
	* Talent
	* Time
	* Money
2. Divide the book into logical chunks and divide the work accordingly.
	* Let the table of contents guide you
1. Each section is recorded and sent to QC.
1. QC sends back list of fixes.
1. When there are no fixes left, the recording(s) go to postproduction and production proceeds onto the next logical chunk.
1. Postproduction submits the master* copy for distribution.

&#x2a; "prime", "pristine", "finalized"

## Studio Recordings

90% of books move on to post-production.

* Narrator and director work as a team.
* Engineer and director provide immediate quality assurance
* Director and quality control cooperate directly with each other.
* Errors are caught in a timely manner.

If post-production is in the loop with with the studio, almost every book recorded gets finalized for distribution.

## Remote recordings

80% of books die in production.

1. There's no director to sustain quality assurance.
1. There's no engineer to maintain technological assets.
1. There's no quality control

	The deadline runs the show.

1. Lack of communication leads to lack of cooperation.
1. Life happens.
	* Interest wanes
	* Minimal gratification
	* Blame game
	
1. Participants drop out of the project.

&#x2a; Books narrated from home studios tend to pass rudimentary quality control requirements (noise abatement, room tone continuity, signal-to-noise ration) but tend to require greater postproduction to remove mouth noises (lip smacking, whistling noses, rumbling stomachs).


# *Do*s and *Don't*s
This section is focused on narration.  Tips for directors, engineers, post-production, makrup, and collaboration will be found at [`https://github.com/XioNYC/WftE`](https://github.com/XioNYC).
